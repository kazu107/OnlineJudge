The directory `next-app/problems/problem_tsp/` will be created by `create_file_with_block` if it doesn't exist.
The Python script includes:
- Argument parsing and basic error handling for arguments.
- Reading and parsing the city data JSON and user solution file.
- Extensive validation:
    - Empty solution check.
    - Tour length check.
    - Start/end city matching.
    - Validity of all city IDs in the tour.
    - Check for duplicate city visits (before returning to start).
    - Check if all unique cities are visited.
- Calculation of total tour distance using Euclidean distance.
- Scoring logic:
    - If `optimal_distance` is provided and valid:
        - Full points if `total_distance <= optimal_distance`.
        - Linearly scaled points if `optimal_distance < total_distance <= optimal_distance * 1.5`.
        - 0 points if `total_distance > optimal_distance * 1.5`.
    - If `optimal_distance` is not provided or invalid: `max_points / 2` for any valid tour.
- Output of results in the specified JSON format (`score`, `message`, `error`). Scores are rounded.

This script seems to cover all requirements.The generic I/O specification for custom evaluation programs and the TSP evaluation script (`evaluator_tsp.py`) have been defined and created.

**1. Custom Evaluation Program - Generic I/O Specification**

*   **Input (via Command Line Arguments):**
    1.  `argv[1]`: Path to the user's solution file (content from user's standard output).
    2.  `argv[2]`: Path to the test case data file (e.g., city coordinates for TSP, as defined in `meta.json`'s `test_cases[i].data_file`).
    3.  `argv[3]`: Maximum achievable points for this test case (from `meta.json`'s `test_cases[i].points`, passed as a numerical string).

*   **Output (to Standard Output):**
    *   A single line containing a JSON object.
    *   **Required JSON Key:**
        *   `score` (number): The points awarded to the user for the test case. This value must be between 0 and the maximum points (inclusive).
    *   **Optional JSON Keys:**
        *   `message` (string): A human-readable message providing feedback to the user (e.g., "Total distance: 123.45", "Valid tour, but not optimal.", "Path found with 7 segments.").
        *   `error` (string): An error message if the evaluation script encounters an issue with the user's solution (e.g., invalid format, invalid tour) or if an internal error occurs within the evaluator. If an `error` key is present, the `score` should typically be 0.

    *   **Example Output Lines:**
        ```json
        {"score": 90, "message": "Total distance: 250.75. Close to optimal."}
        ```
        ```json
        {"score": 0, "message": "Invalid tour: Not all cities were visited.", "error": "Incomplete tour."}
        ```
        ```json
        {"score": 0, "error": "Evaluator script failed: Could not parse city data file."}
        ```

**2. TSP Evaluation Program (`evaluator_tsp.py`)**

*   **File Path:** `next-app/problems/problem_tsp/evaluator_tsp.py`
*   **Functionality:**
    *   The script takes three command-line arguments: user solution file path, city data file path, and maximum points.
    *   **City Data File Format (JSON):**
        ```json
        {
          "cities": [
            {"id": "A", "x": 0, "y": 0},
            {"id": "B", "x": 10, "y": 0},
            // ... more cities
          ],
          "optimal_distance": 40.0 // Optional: Optimal tour distance for scoring reference
        }
        ```
    *   **User Solution File Format (Text):** A single line of space-separated city IDs representing the tour (e.g., `A B C D A`). The tour must start and end at the same city.
    *   **Evaluation Logic:**
        1.  **Parses Inputs:** Reads and parses the user's tour and the city data. Handles file errors and JSON parsing errors.
        2.  **Validates Tour:**
            *   Checks for an empty solution.
            *   Verifies that the tour starts and ends at the same city.
            *   Ensures all city IDs in the tour are valid (exist in the city data).
            *   Checks that the tour visits all unique cities specified in the problem exactly once (before returning to the start).
            *   Ensures no city (other than the start/end point) is visited multiple times.
            *   If any validation fails, it outputs a JSON with `score: 0` and an appropriate `error` and/or `message`.
        3.  **Calculates Distance:** If the tour is valid, it calculates the total Euclidean distance of the path traversed.
        4.  **Calculates Score:**
            *   If `optimal_distance` is present and valid in the city data:
                *   `total_distance <= optimal_distance`: Awards `max_points`.
                *   `optimal_distance < total_distance <= optimal_distance * 1.5`: Awards points linearly scaled down from `max_points`. The score is calculated as `max_points * (1 - (total_distance - optimal_distance) / (optimal_distance * 0.5))`, ensuring it's not negative.
                *   `total_distance > optimal_distance * 1.5`: Awards 0 points.
            *   If `optimal_distance` is not present or invalid: Awards `max_points / 2` for any valid tour as a fallback.
        5.  **Outputs Result:** Prints a JSON object to standard output containing the calculated `score` (rounded to the nearest integer) and a `message` (including the calculated total distance and the optimal distance, if available).

The Python script `next-app/problems/problem_tsp/evaluator_tsp.py` was created successfully with the logic described above.
